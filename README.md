Taste - putting an food on a tastes diagram (SOUR-SWEET-SALTY-BITTER-UMAMI diagram), essentially rank it as a dot on this cartesian system,  also look into how to encode/codify taste with computing

Smell - do a similar thing for smells as for the taste stuff, also look into how to encode/codify smell with computing

Touch/feel - look into how to codify that

Trying clothes - using computer vision to see whether clothes actually fit your not (attache the touch/feel experience, not only the seeing/visual part)
